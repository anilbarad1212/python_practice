Absolutely! Here are some mathematical programming challenges for you to solve:

1. Sum and Product:
Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input, calculates and prints their sum and product.

2. Factorial Function:
Create a Python function to calculate the factorial of a given number. Test the function by calculating the factorial of a user-input number.

3. Fibonacci Series:
Write a Python program or function to generate and print the first N terms of the Fibonacci series, where N is a user-input number.

4. Prime Number Checker:
Develop a Python function that checks whether a given number is a prime number. Get a number from the user and determine if it's prime or not.

5. Area of a Circle:
Write a Python program that calculates and prints the area of a circle based on its radius. Get the radius as user input.

6. Simple Interest Calculator:
Create a Python program to calculate the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time. Get these values as user input.

7. Power of a Number:
Write a Python function to calculate the power of a number. Take the base and exponent as user input.

8. Square Root Approximation:
Implement a Python program to approximate the square root of a number using methods like Newton's method or the Babylonian method.

9. GCD (Greatest Common Divisor):
Develop a Python function to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

10. Number Guessing Game:
Create a simple number guessing game in Python. Generate a random number, and let the user guess until they get it right, providing hints along the way.
